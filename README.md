# assessment-2-ALadysz

I chose to make a golf/pinball hybrid for this assessment.
Inspired by Sushi Cat made by Armor Games (NOT MINE)- my game is based on slightly different mechanics though.
Wait for cat to be above desired position to drop and click the drop button to make it fall.
FitScreen script not mine - link to source in code :)

Assets used in game:
-I made the cat asset :)
